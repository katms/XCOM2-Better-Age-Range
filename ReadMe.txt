Changes the age range of randomly generated personnel from 25-35 to 18-50. Specific backstories are configured to have a specific age range, this can be configured in XComBirthdays.ini  By default this mainly affects civilian staff with prewar backstories.

This mod also allows for specifying an age range for custom bios, as long as its index is known.

No overrides. 

Known issues: 
* Soldiers saved to the character pool with generic bios will get a new birthdate every time they appear. 


General caveat: this mod doesn't make any changes to how the base game generates backgrounds, just overwrites them before you see anything. So if any characters or backgrounds are generated where the mod doesn't or can't anticipate them, they'll always be 25-35.
