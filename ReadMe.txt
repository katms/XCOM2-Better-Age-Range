Changes the age range of randomly generated personnel to 18-50. Configurable in XComBirthdays.ini.

No overrides.

Known issues:
* You can now recruit teenagers who apparently became war heroes before they were born.
* Character pool soldiers with generic bios will get a bew birthdate every time they appear.
* General caveat: this mod doesn't make any changes to how the base game generates backgrounds, just overwrites them before you see anything. So if any characters or backgrounds are generated where the mod doesn't or can't anticipate them, they'll still be 25-35.
