Changes the age range of randomly generated personnel to 18-50. Specific backstories are configured to have a specific age range (all war heroes from the previous invasion are at least 38), and can be changed in XComBirthdays.ini

This mod also allows for specifying an age range for custom bios, as long as its index is known.

No overrides. 

Known issues: 
* Character pool soldiers with generic bios will get a new birthdate every time they appear. 
* Soldiers awarded from scanning points of interest not affected. 
* General caveat: this mod doesn't make any changes to how the base game generates backgrounds, just overwrites them before you see anything. So if any characters or backgrounds are generated where the mod doesn't or can't anticipate them, they'll still be 25-35.
